"""Conversion of addresses and keys from Bitcoin to Namecoin format

This module provides methods that convert addresses and keys from the
Bitcoin formats to Namecoin versions.  This can be applied in tests
where Bitcoin addresses and keys are used as magic strings upstream,
but the code under test requires the Namecoin forms."""
