A JSON-RPC server that implements methods required by games in exactly the
same way as Xaya Core does, executing them based on Electrum.  This server
can be run in addition to the "standard" Electrum JSON-RPC server, and
allows to connect games to Electrum that are originally written for the
Xaya Core JSON-RPC interface.
